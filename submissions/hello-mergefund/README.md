# Hello MergeFund! - Space Invaders Submission

A browser-based Space Invaders game where you shoot down letters to spell "Hello MergeFund". Winners get a firework display! Built for the MergeFund "Hello MergeFund" challenge.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This is a fun twist on the classic Space Invaders. Instead of just shooting aliens, you collect the letters to spell out "Hello MergeFund". Once you get them all, you get a fireworks show and a big win screen.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- HTML5 Canvas for the game and fireworks
- Web Audio API for sound effects

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. *All done!*

## üí° Creative Approach
- I chose to mimic the classic arcade shooter game, "Space Invaders".
    - I tried to preserve the "retro" feel as best as possible, by using pixel graphics and synth sound effects.
- I wanted to emphasize the celebration of MergeFund's launch with an energetic win screen.

## üì∏ Example
